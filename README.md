# Introducing Bitter. It's what's not happening.

Full-stack clone of Twitter. By Ellen Tomlins. Started in CS 396.

Forget the sordid past of Twitter, victim to the capricious will of Elon Musk. Enter the benevolent Ellon Musk, committed to the same ideas of free expression while acknowledging that that liberty of free speech afforded to every human person often brings along, well, bitterness!

So come on over (not tweet, but) bleat to your heart's content.
